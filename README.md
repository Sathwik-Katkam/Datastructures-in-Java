# Datastructures-in-Java
"CREATED THIS REPOSITORY AS THE EXISTING SOURCES LACKED  CONSISTENT FORMAT OF IMPLEMENTATION" - 
This Repository is created to help people who want to learn the implementation of Datastructures in java, I have found it difficult to find authentic sources which have a simple and easily understandable implementations, Most of the sources like geeksforgeeks, Javatpoint... were very helpful but lacked CONSISTENT FORMAT of implementation.
